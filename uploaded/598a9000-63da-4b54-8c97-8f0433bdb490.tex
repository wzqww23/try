\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & (x^{2}-4x+4)-4+(y^{2}+6y+9)-9-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=9 \\
3: & (2,-3) \\
4: & h=(11-2)/(0-(-3))\cdots3 \\
5: & k\neq-(1)/(3) \\
6: & (y-0)=-(1)/(3)(x-11) \\
7: & y=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
8: & h_2=(2+7)/(-3+2)=-3 \\
9: & k_{\perp} k=(1)/(3) \\
10: & (y-0)=(1)/(3)(x+7) \\
11: & y=(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3) \\
12: & (1)/(3)x+(7)/(3)=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
13: & (2)/(3)x=(4)/(3) \\
14: & x=2

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done on finding the center of the circle, point C, as (2,-3) in step 3.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{Good job on finding the gradient of the line AC as 1/3 in step 4.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{Correctly found the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 in step 8.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{You have written the equation of the tangent at A correctly in step 6.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{You made an error in step 12. The correct equation should be $(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3)=-(1)/(3)x+(33)/(3)$.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{Unfortunately, you did not find the correct coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines. The correct answer is (2,27).}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 4/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You did a good job on finding the center of the circle, the gradient of the line AC, and the equation of the tangent at A. However, you made an error in step 12 when equating the two tangent equations. Make sure to double-check your calculations and try again. Keep up the good work!
