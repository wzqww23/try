\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & (x^{2}-4x+4)-4+(y^{2}+6y+9)-9-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=9 \\
3: & (2,-3) \\
4: & h=(11-2)/(0-(-3))\cdots3 \\
5: & k\neq-(1)/(3) \\
6: & (y-0)=-(1)/(3)(x-11) \\
7: & y=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
8: & h_2=(2+7)/(-3+2)=-3 \\
9: & k_{\perp} k=(1)/(3) \\
10: & (y-0)=(1)/(3)(x+7) \\
11: & y=(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3) \\
12: & (1)/(3)x+(7)/(3)=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
13: & (2)/(3)x=(4)/(3) \\
14: & x=2

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle as (2,-3) in step 3.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{Good job in finding the gradient of the line AC as 1/3 in step 4.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{Correctly found the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 in step 8.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{You have written the equation of the tangent at A correctly in step 6.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{You made an error in step 13. The correct equation should be $(2)/(3)x=(4)/(3)- (7)/(3)$, not $(2)/(3)x=(4)/(3)$.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{Since you made an error in step 13, you didn't find the correct coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 4/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You did a good job in finding the center of the circle, the gradient of the line AC, and the equation of the tangent at A. However, you made an error in step 13 when finding the x-coordinate of the point of intersection. Make sure to double-check your calculations and try again. Keep up the good work!
