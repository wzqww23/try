\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+6y-77=0 \\
2: & y=0 \\
3: & x^{2}-4x-77=0 \\
4: & (x^{2}-4x+4)=81 \\
5: & (x-2)^{2}=9^{2} \\
6: & x_1=11, x_2=-7 \\
7: & A(11, 0) \\
8: & B(-7, 0) \\
9: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=90 \\
10: & 0(2,-3) \\
11: & (2,-3),(11,0) \\
12: & q_{11}t_{11}=(0+3)/(11-2)=n(1)/(3) \\
13: & t_1=B-3 \\
14: & y_1=-3x+33 \\
15: & (-7,0)(4,0)^{(2,-3)} \\
16: & t_{12}= (-3)/(2+7)=-(1)/(3) \\
17: & t_2=3 \\
18: & y_3=3x+21 \\
19: & -3x+33=3x+21 \\
20: & -x+11=x+7 \\
21: & (2, 27) \\
22: & x=2
\end{align*}

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle as (2, -3) in step 11.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{Good job for finding the gradient of the line AC as 1/3 in step 12.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{Correctly found the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 in step 17.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{Great work for finding the equation of the tangent at A as y = 3x + 21 in step 18.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{Unfortunately, you did not find the equation of the tangent at B.}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 5/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You did a great job overall! You were able to find the center of the circle, the gradient of the line AC, the gradient and equation of the tangent at A, and the coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines. However, you missed finding the equation of the tangent at B. Keep practicing and you'll get even better!
