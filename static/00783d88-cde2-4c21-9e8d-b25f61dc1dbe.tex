\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle, point C, as (2,-3) in step 3.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{red}{Unfortunately, you made a mistake in finding the gradient of the line AC. The correct gradient should be -1/3, not -(1/3)x-(7/3) in step 4.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{Good job for finding the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 in step 6 and the gradient of the tangent at B as -3 in step 7.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the equations of the tangents at A and B in steps 6 and 7.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{green}{Good job for setting up the equation to find the point of intersection in step 12.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines as (2,27) in steps 13 and 14.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 5/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You did a great job overall, but you made a small mistake in finding the gradient of the line AC. Make sure to double-check your calculations and remember that the gradient is the change in y divided by the change in x. Keep up the good work!
