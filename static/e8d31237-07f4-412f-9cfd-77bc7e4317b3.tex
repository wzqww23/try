\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+6y-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}-4-9=77 \\
3: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=90 \\
4: & \text{Therefore, center }(2,-3) \\
5: & \frac{-3-0}{2-(-7)}=\frac{-5}{i} \\
6: & i3 \\
7: & \frac{-3-0}{2-11}=\frac{1}{3} \\
8: & -3 \\
9: & y=3x+21 \\
10: & y=-3x+33 \\
11: & 3x+21=-3x+33 \\
12: & 6x=54 \\
13: & x=9 \\
14: & y=58 \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle as (2,-3) in step 4.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{red}{Unfortunately, you made an error in step 5 when calculating the gradient of line AC. The correct gradient should be -1/3.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{Good job for finding the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 in step 6.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the equations of the tangents as y=3x+21 and y=-3x+33 in steps 9 and 10.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{green}{Good job for setting up the equation to find the point of intersection in step 11.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{Unfortunately, you made an error in steps 13 and 14 when finding the coordinates of the point of intersection. The correct coordinates should be (2,27).}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 4/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You have a good understanding of the concepts, but you made a couple of errors in your calculations. Make sure to double-check your work and be careful with your calculations. Keep practicing, and you'll get better!
