\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+6y-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}-4-9=77 \\
3: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=90 \\
4: & \text{centre of circle is }(2,-3) \\
5: & \frac{-3-0}{2-(-7)}=\frac{-3}{9}=-\frac{1}{3} \\
6: & \text{Gradient of tangent at A is } 3 \\
7: & \text{Gradient of tangent at B is } -3 \\
8: & y=3x+21 \\
9: & y=-3x+33 \\
10: & 3x+21=-3x+33 \\
11: & 6x=12 \\
12: & x=2 \\
13: & y=27 \\
\end{align*}
