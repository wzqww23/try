\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+6y-77=0 \\
2: & y=0 \quad x^{2}-4x-77=0 \\
3: & x_1=11 \quad x_2=-7 \\
4: & x^{2}-4x+4-4+y^{2}+6y+9-9-77=0 \\
5: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}-90=0 \\
6: & (2,-3) \\
7: & r=3\sqrt{10} \\
8: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=90 \\
9: & Q(2,-3) \\
10: & y=mx+c \\
11: & (-3-0)/(2-11)=(1)/(3) \\
12: & y=(1)/(3)x+c \\
13: & y=(11)/(3)+c \\

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Step 6: The student correctly identified the center of the circle as (2,-3).}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{red}{The student did not show a correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{red}{The student did not find the gradient of the tangent at A or B.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{red}{The student did not write the equations of the tangents at A and B.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{The student did not show a correct method for finding the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{The student did not find the coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 1/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You correctly identified the center of the circle, but you did not follow the correct method to find the gradients of the tangent lines and their equations. To improve, you should review the concepts of tangents and gradients, and practice finding the point of intersection of two lines. Keep working on it, and you'll get better!
