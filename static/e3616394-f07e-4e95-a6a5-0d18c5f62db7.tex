\begin{align*}
1: & y=0 \\
2: & x_1=11 \\
3: & x_2=-7 \\
4: & x^{2}-4x-77=0 \\
5: & (b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac})/(2a)a-1b=-4 \\
6: & (=-77 \\
7: & =11 \\
8: & -7 \\
9: & 2x+2y(dy)/(dx)-4+6(dy)/(dx)=0. \\
10: & (dy)/(dx)(2y+6)+2x-4=0. \\
11: & (dx)/(dx)=(4-2x)/(2y+6) \\
12: & a:(4-2z)/(6)=-3 \\
13: & b:(4+14)/(6)=3

\textbf{Comments:} Your work does not address the problem of finding the point of intersection of the tangent lines to the circle at points A and B. Please review the concepts of circle equations, tangent lines, and gradients. Then, try to find the center of the circle, the gradients of the lines connecting the center to points A and B, and the gradients of the tangent lines at A and B. Finally, find the equations of the tangent lines and their point of intersection.
