\textbf{Comments:} It seems that you have not attempted the given question about finding the point of intersection of tangent lines to a circle. The steps you have provided do not relate to the problem. Please review the question and try again. Make sure to find the center of the circle, the gradients of the lines connecting the center to points A and B, and the equations of the tangent lines before finding their point of intersection.
