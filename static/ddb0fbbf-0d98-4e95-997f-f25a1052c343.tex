\textbf{Comments:} It seems that you have not attempted to solve the given problem about the circle and tangent lines. Please review the problem statement and try again. Make sure to find the center of the circle, the gradients of the lines connecting the center to points A and B, and the equations of the tangent lines. Then, find the point of intersection of the tangent lines.
