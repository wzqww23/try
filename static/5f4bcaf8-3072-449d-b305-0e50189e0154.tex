\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & y=0 \\
2: & x_1=11 \\
3: & x_2=-7 \\
4: & x^{2}-4x-77=0 \\
5: & (b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac})/(2a)a-1b=-4 \\
6: & (=-77 \\
7: & =11 \\
8: & -7 \\
9: & 2x+2y(dy)/(dx)-4+6(dy)/(dx)=0. \\
10: & (dy)/(dx)(2y+6)+2x-4=0. \\
11: & (dx)/(dx)=(4-2x)/(2y+6) \\
12: & a:(4-2z)/(6)=-3 \\
13: & b:(4+14)/(6)=3
\end{align*}

\textbf{Comments:} Your work does not address the problem of finding the point of intersection of the tangent lines to the circle at points A and B. Please review the problem statement and the mark scheme, and try to follow the steps outlined in the mark scheme to solve the problem. Remember to find the center of the circle, the gradient of the line AC, the gradient of the tangent lines at points A and B, the equations of the tangent lines, and the point of intersection of the tangent lines. Keep practicing, and you'll get better!
