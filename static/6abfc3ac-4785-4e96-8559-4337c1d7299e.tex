\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^2+y^2-4x+6y-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^2+(y+3)^2-4-9=77 \\
3: & (x-2)^2+(y+3)^2=90 \\
4: & \text{Centre of circle is }(2,-3) \\
5: & \text{Gradient of AC } = \frac{-3-0}{2-(-7)} = -\frac{1}{3} \\
6: & \text{Gradient of tangent at A } = 3 \\
7: & \text{Gradient of BC } = \frac{-3-0}{2-11} = \frac{1}{3} \\
8: & \text{Gradient of tangent at B } = -3 \\
9: & \text{Equations of tangents: } y = 3x + 21, y = -3x + 33 \\
10: & 3x + 21 = -3x + 33 \\
11: & 6x = 12 \\
12: & x = 2 \\
13: & y = 27 \\
\end{align*}
