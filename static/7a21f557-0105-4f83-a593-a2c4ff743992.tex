\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{red}{Step 2 is an attempt to write the equation of the circle, but it is incorrect. The correct equation is $(x-2)^2+(y+3)^2=40$.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{Step 7 shows a correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC as $\frac{1}{3}$.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{red}{The gradients of the tangent lines at points A and B are not calculated.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{red}{The equations of the tangent lines are not found.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{The method for finding the point of intersection of the tangent lines is not shown.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{The coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines are not found.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 1/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You have found the gradient of the line AC correctly, but you need to work on finding the equations of the tangent lines and the point of intersection. Make sure to review the concepts of perpendicular lines and how to find the equation of a line given a point and a slope. Keep practicing and you'll get better! Good luck!
