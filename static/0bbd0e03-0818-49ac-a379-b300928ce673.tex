\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
Step 1: & (x^{2}-4x+4)-4+(y^{2}+6y+9)-9-77=0 \\
Step 2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=9 \\
Step 3: & (2,-3) \\
Step 4: & h=(11-2)/(h-3)=3 \\
Step 5: & k!=-(1)/(3) \\
Step 6: & (y-0)=-(1)/(3)(x-11) \\
Step 7: & y=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
Step 8: & h_2=(2+7)/(-3+2)=-3 \\
Step 9: & k _|_ k=(1)/(3) \\
Step 10: & (y-0)=(1)/(3)(x+7) \\
Step 11: & y=(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3) \\
Step 12: & (1)/(3)x+(7)/(3)=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
Step 13: & (2)/(3)x=(4)/(3) \\
Step 14: & x=2 \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{You correctly identified the center of the circle as (2,-3) in step 3. Well done!}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{red}{You did not show a correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC. Please remember to calculate the gradient using the formula (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{You correctly found the gradients of the tangents at A and B in steps 4 and 8, and you correctly wrote the equations of the tangents in steps 6 and 10. Good job!}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{You correctly found the point of intersection of the tangent lines in steps 12 and 14. Excellent work!}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 3/4}

\textbf{Comments:} You have a good understanding of the concepts involved in this problem. However, you missed out on showing the correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC. Remember to use the formula (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) to calculate the gradient. Keep practicing and you will improve!
