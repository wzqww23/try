\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & (x^{2}-4x+4)+(y^{2}+6y+9)-13-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=90 \\
3: & C: (2, -3) \\
4: & OA, OB \\
5: & y=kx+c \\
6: & -3=2k+c \\
7: & 0=-7k+c \\
8: & k=-\frac{1}{3} \\
9: & k=3 \\
10: & c=21 \\
11: & y=kx+c \\
12: & -3=2k+c \\
13: & 0=11k+c \\
14: & k=\frac{1}{3} \\
15: & k=-3 \\
16: & c=33 \\
17: & y=3x+210 \\
18: & y=-3x+33 \\
19: & 0=0=0=-6x+12 \Rightarrow x=2,y=27 \\
\end{align*}

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Correctly found the center of the circle as (2, -3) in step 3.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{Correctly found the gradient of line AC as -1/3 in step 8 and the gradient of line BC as 1/3 in step 14.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{Correctly found the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 in step 9 and the gradient of the tangent at B as -3 in step 15.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{red}{The equations of the tangents should be y=3x+21 and y=-3x+33, but the student wrote y=3x+210 in step 17.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{green}{Correctly set up the equation to find the point of intersection in step 19.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{green}{Correctly found the coordinates of the point of intersection as (2, 27) in step 19.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 5/6}

\textbf{Comments:} Good job on finding the center of the circle, the gradients of the lines, and the point of intersection. However, there was a small mistake in writing the equation of the tangent at A. Make sure to double-check your calculations and equations to avoid such errors in the future.
