\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle as (2,-3) in step 6.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{red}{You did not show a correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the gradient of the tangent at A or B.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{red}{You did not write the equations of the tangents at A and B.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{You did not show a correct method for finding the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 1/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You have found the center of the circle correctly, but you need to work on finding the gradients of the lines connecting the center to points A and B, and then find the gradients of the tangents at A and B. After that, you should write the equations of the tangents and find their point of intersection. Keep practicing, and you'll get better at this!
