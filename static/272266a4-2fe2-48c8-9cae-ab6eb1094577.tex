\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^2+y^2-4x+6y-77=0 \\
2: & y=0,x^2-4x-77=0 \\
3: & x_1=11, x_0= \\
4: & x^2-4x+4-4+y^2+6y+9-9-77=0 \\
5: & (x-2)^2+(y+3)^2-90=0 \\
6: & (2,-3) \\
7: & r=3\sqrt{10} \\
8: & (x-2)^2+(y+3)^2=90 \\
9: & \theta(2,-3) \\
10: & y=mx+c, \\
11: & (-3-0)/(2-11)=(1)/(3),(-3-0)/(2+7)=-(1)/(3) \\
12: & y=(1)/(3)x+c,y=(1)/(3)x+c \\
13: & 0=(11)/(3)+c,0=-(7)/(3)+c \\
14: & c=-(1)/(3),c=(7)/(3) \\
15: & y=(1)/(3)x-(11)/(3),y=(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3)
\end{align*}

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle as (2,-3) in step 6.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{Good job for finding the gradient of the line AC as 1/3 in step 11.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{red}{Unfortunately, you did not find the gradient of the tangent lines at points A and B.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the equations of the tangent lines at points A and B.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 2/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You have correctly found the center of the circle and the gradient of the line AC. However, you need to find the gradient of the tangent lines at points A and B, and then find their equations. Finally, you need to find the point of intersection of these tangent lines. Keep practicing, and you'll get there!
