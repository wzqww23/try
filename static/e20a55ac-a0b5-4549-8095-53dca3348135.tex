\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+6y-77=0 \\
2: & y=0 \\
3: & x^{2}-4x-77=0 \\
4: & (x^{2}-4x+4)=81 \\
5: & (x-2)^{2}=9^{2} \\
6: & x_1=11, x_2=-7 \\
7: & A(11, 0) \\
8: & B(-7, 0) \\
9: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=90 \\
10: & 0(2,-3) \\
11: & (2,-3),(11,0) \\
12: & q_{11}t_{11}=(0+3)/(11-2)=n(1)/(3) \\
13: & t_1=B-3 \\
14: & y_1=-3x+33 \\
