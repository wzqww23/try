\begin{align*}
1: & \quad â†º \\
2: & \quad (2y+6)(dy)/(dx)=4-2x \\
3: & \quad (dy)/(dx)=(4-2x)/(2y+6) \\
4: & \quad +at(11,0)=(1)/(3) \\
5: & \quad y=(1)/(3x)-(11)/(3) \\
6: & \quad 0 +a+(-70)=-3 \\
7: & \quad y=-3x-21 \\
8: & \quad (1)/(3)x=(11)/(3)=-3x-21 \\
9: & \quad (10)/(3)x=-(52)/(3) \\
10: & \quad x=-3.2-y=-3.4 \\

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{red}{You did not write the center of the circle, point C, as (2,-3).}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{You showed a correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC as (1/3) in step 3.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{You found the gradient of the tangent at B as -3 in step 6.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{You found the equation of the tangent at B as y=-3x-21 in step 7.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the correct point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the correct coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 3/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You have shown a good understanding of finding the gradient and equation of the tangent lines. However, you did not find the center of the circle and the correct point of intersection of the tangent lines. Make sure to review the method for finding the center of a circle and double-check your calculations for the point of intersection. Keep up the good work!
