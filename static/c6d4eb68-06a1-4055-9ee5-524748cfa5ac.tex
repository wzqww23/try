\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & x^{2}-4x+4-4+y^{2}+6y+9-9-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}-90=0 \\
3: & (2,-3) \\
4: & r=3\sqrt{10} \\
5: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=90 \\
6: & (-3-0)/(2-11)=(1)/(3) \\
7: & y=(1)/(3)x+c \\
8: & y=(1)/(3)x-(11)/(3) \\
9: & (-3-0)/(2+7)=-(1)/(3) \\
10: & y=(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3) \\
11: & =3,-3 \\
12: & \{y=3x+21 \\
13: & y=-3x+33 \\
14: & x=2 \\
15: & y=27 \\
16: & (2,2)
\end{align*}

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle as (2,-3) in step 3.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{green}{Good job for showing the correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC as 1/3 in step 6.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{You correctly found the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 and the gradient of the tangent at B as -3 in step 11.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{Great work for finding the equations of the tangents as y=3x+21 and y=-3x+33 in steps 12 and 13.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{green}{You correctly set up the equation to find the point of intersection in step 14.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{Unfortunately, you made an error in the final step. The correct coordinates of the point of intersection are (2,27), not (2,2).}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 5/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You did a great job working through the problem and finding the equations of the tangents. However, be careful with your final calculations, as you made an error in the last step. Keep up the good work!
