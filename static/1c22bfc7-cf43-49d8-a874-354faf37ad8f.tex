\begin{align*}
1: & (x^{2}-4x+4)-4+(y^{2}+6y+9)-9-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=9 \\
3: & (2,-3) \\
4: & h=(11-2)/(h-3)=3 \\
5: & k!=-(1)/(3) \\
6: & (y-0)=-(1)/(3)(x-11) \\
7: & y=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
8: & h_2=(2+7)/(-3+2)=-3 \\
9: & k_\perp k=(1)/(3) \\
10: & (y-0)=(1)/(3)(x+7) \\
11: & y=(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3) \\

\textbf{Feedback and Grade:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Mark 1] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the center of the circle as (2,-3) in step 3.}
\item[Mark 2] \textcolor{red}{You did not show a correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC.}
\item[Mark 3] \textcolor{green}{Good job for finding the gradient of the tangent at A as 3 in step 4 and the gradient of the tangent at B as -3 in step 8.}
\item[Mark 4] \textcolor{green}{Well done for finding the equations of the tangents as y=3x+21 in step 10 and y=-3x+33 in step 6.}
\item[Mark 5] \textcolor{green}{Good job for setting up the equation to find the point of intersection in step 12.}
\item[Mark 6] \textcolor{red}{You did not find the correct coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Score: 4/6}

\textbf{Comments:} You did a good job in finding the center of the circle, the gradients of the tangents, and the equations of the tangents. However, you did not show a correct method for finding the gradient of the line AC, and you did not find the correct coordinates of the point of intersection of the tangent lines. Keep practicing and you'll get better!
