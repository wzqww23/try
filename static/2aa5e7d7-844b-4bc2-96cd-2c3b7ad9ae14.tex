\textbf{Comments:} It seems that you have not attempted to solve the given problem. Please review the question and try to apply the appropriate methods to find the point of intersection of the tangent lines to the circle at points A and B. Remember to find the center of the circle, the gradients of the lines connecting the center to points A and B, and the gradients of the tangent lines. Then, write the equations of the tangent lines and find their point of intersection. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it!
