\textbf{Student Answer:}
\begin{align*}
1: & (x^{2}-4x+4)-4+(y^{2}+6y+9)-9-77=0 \\
2: & (x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2}=9 \\
3: & (2,-3) \\
4: & h=(11-2)/(h-3)=3 \\
5: & k!=-(1)/(3) \\
6: & (y-0)=-(1)/(3)(x-11) \\
7: & y=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
8: & h_2=(2+7)/(-3+2)=-3 \\
9: & k_\perp k=(1)/(3) \\
10: & (y-0)=(1)/(3)(x+7) \\
11: & y=(1)/(3)x+(7)/(3) \\
12: & (1)/(3)x+(7)/(3)=-(1)/(3)x+(11)/(3) \\
13: & (2)/(3)x=(4)/(3) \\
14: & x=2
